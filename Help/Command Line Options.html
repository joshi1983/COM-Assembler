<H1>Command Line Options</H1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<dd>If you want to use another code editor or assemble code from your own programs, you can create a batch file that contains DOS commands that can tell the assembler what to do.
<dd><strong>Caution</strong> - watch out for using spaces in your file names.  They parse the parameters.  I suggest using the underscore, '_', character instead.

<H2>Options</H2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assembly Process Document</strong> - You can set an option to create a text file that contains information on how the source file was assembled using the <font color="red"><b>makeprocdoc</b></font> command.</li>
<li><strong>Error List Files</strong> - To set the file for outputting the error list, use the <font color="red"><b>-e</b></font> command.  Follow this by the name of your text file.</li>
<li><strong>Load File</strong> - Load a file into the GUI using the <font color="red"><b>-l</b></font> command.  The following extentions will work: *.com; *.exe; *.txt; *.asm; *.inc</li>
<li><strong>No Close</strong> - if you specify the output file, the program will usually close just after creating the output files.  If you want the assembler to stay running, use the <font color="red"><b>noclose</b></font> command.</li>
<li><strong>Output</strong> - Specify the output program file using <font color="red"><b>-o</b></font> or just by giving the com program's name.  If you use the -e command, put the name of the program after it.</li>
<li><strong>Source</strong> - Specify the source assembly file using <font color="red"><b>-s</b></font> or just by listing the assembly source file.  This is to be followed by the name of your source file.</li>

</ul>
