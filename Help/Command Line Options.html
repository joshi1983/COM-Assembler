		<h1>Command Line Options</h1>
		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>If you want to use another code editor or assemble code from your own programs, you can create a batch file that contains DOS commands that can tell the assembler what to do.</p>
		<p><strong>Caution</strong> - watch out for using spaces in your file names.  They parse the parameters.  I suggest using the underscore, '_', character instead.</p>

		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Assembly Process Document</strong> - You can set an option to create a text file
			that contains information on how the source file was assembled using the
			<span class="command-line-argument">makeprocdoc</span> command.</li>
			<li><strong>Error List Files</strong> - To set the file for outputting the error list, use the
			<span class="command-line-argument">-e</span> command.  Follow this by the name of your text file.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Load File</strong> - Load a file into the GUI using the <span class="command-line-argument">-l</span> command.
			The following extentions will work: *.com; *.exe; *.txt; *.asm; *.inc</li>
			<li><strong>No Close</strong> - if you specify the output file, the program will usually close just after
			creating the output files.  If you want the assembler to stay running, use the
			<span class="command-line-argument">noclose</span> command.</li>
			<li><strong>Output</strong> - Specify the output program file using <span class="command-line-argument">-o</span>
			or just by giving the com program's name.  If you use the -e command, put the name of the program after it.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Source</strong> - Specify the source assembly file using <span class="command-line-argument">-s</span>
			or just by listing the assembly source file.  This is to be followed by the name of your source file.
			</li>
		</ul>
