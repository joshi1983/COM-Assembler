		<ul>
		  <li><strong>Comments</strong>
			<ul>
			  <li>can be made using the <b>;</b> symbol or the <b>//</b>
		symbols.</li>
			  <li>multilined comments can be done starting with a "<b>comment *</b>"
		line. The last line of the comment can only contain a single "<b>*</b>"</li>
			</ul>
		  </li>
		  <li><strong>Data</strong> can be defined using <b>db</b> and <b>dw</b>.</li>
		  <li><strong>Labels</strong>
			<ul>
			  <li>can be defined using the <b>:</b> after the name of the
		label. </li>
			  <li>You can also just use a space before a data statement. </li>
			  <li>Refer to the offset of a label using the word offset before
		the label. For example, move the address of label "x" into ax using
		this code... "mov ax, offset x"</li>
			</ul>
		  </li>
		  <li><strong>Memory References</strong> a few addressing modes are
		supported. Click <a href="Memory%20References.html">here</a> for more
		information. </li>
		  <li><strong>Opcodes</strong> use Intel syntax. First is the opcode
		name, if any operands are required, followed by the first operand and
		the second operand. The specific opcodes and operands are determined in
		instruction set files. You can view an alphabetical listing of the
		instruction set by clicking View -&gt; Opcode Listing</li>
		  <li><strong>Immediate values</strong> can be in hex, binary, decimal,
		octal, and character format.
			<ul>
			  <li><strong>Negative</strong> signs can be placed before the
		numbers to make them negative. This works for hex, octal, decimal, and
		binary.</li>
			  <li><strong>Hex</strong>, is indicated by placing the letter 'h'
		after your number. Hex can also be represented in the c++ style
		starting with '0x' followed by the hex digits. </li>
			  <li><strong>Octal</strong> is represented by using the letter 'o'
		at the end of the digits. </li>
			  <li><strong>Binary</strong> is represented by the letter 'b'
		being placed at the end of the digits. </li>
			  <li><strong>Decimal</strong> are represented the usual way. You
		can also use a trailing letter "d". 10 in decimal is the default radix,
		number base, so you don't need anything after the number's digits
		unless you set the radix to something else.</li>
			  <li>For <strong>characters</strong>, use a ' before and after
		the character with the character between.</li>
			  <li>For <strong>strings</strong>, use a ' before and after the
		character string.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2 id="Changes">New and future changes</h2>
		<strong>New Changes</strong>
		<ul>
		  <li>support for memory references</li>
		  <li>disassembling memory references</li>
		  <li>disassembling is working for some programs that don't use data
		definitions</li>
		  <li>eliminated a bug that happens when you use spaces in a memory
		reference</li>
		  <li>eliminated a bug that happens when you try using ',' as an
		immediate value</li>
		  <li>assembles more memory references ie. "WORD PTR [SI+0100h]" This
		way, after disassembling a program that uses them, it can be
		reassembled without problems.</li>
		  <li>an error was fixed when exporting to html and using &lt; and &gt;
		signs in the code.</li>
		  <li>eliminated a bug that eliminates multiple spaces from character
		strings</li>
		  <li>eliminated a bug with memory references that use several constant
		terms</li>
		  <li>eliminated a bug with byte numbers for the assemble process
		document counting up to 0 instead of from 0 to the end of the program</li>
		  <li>eliminated a bug that happens when you use a ',' in a character
		string</li>
		  <li>support for command line options</li>
		  <li>support for labeling data without using a :</li>
		  <li>starting to add a directive for switching case sensativity on but
		not working yet</li>
		  <li>a little error check to prevent loading instruction set files
		more than once using the include directive</li>
		  <li>error assembling the statement "push 5". It assembles the same as
		"push gs"</li>
		  <li>eliminated a bug that happens when you use a ':' when you aren't
		defining a label for example " mov al,':' "</li>
		  <li>eliminated a bug that happens when a numarical operand is not an
		immediate value. ie. shr reg16,"1" in the instruction set files. shr
		ax,1 will assemble right but shr ax,2 will assemble exactly the same
		way.</li>
		  <li>support for multilined comments</li>
		  <li>a check for duplicate instructions loaded from the instruction
		set files</li>
		  <li>instruction set files basically complete except for instructions
		using 3 operands</li>
		  <li>stopped the assembler from loading instruction set files twice</li>
		  <li>support for a radix directive used in Tasm example line ".Radix
		10h" This sets the default number base. The base used when there is no
		letter left behind.</li>
		  <li>all addressing modes are supported however there are no multiple
		passes for optimization</li>
		  <li>eliminated a bug that happens when outputting to html lines of
		code with : where there is no label</li>
		  <li>support for segment overrides (ie. a memory reference statement
		like... "byte ptr[es: si]")</li>
		  <li>support for instructions that use 3 operands</li>
		  <li>using multiple passes to find the optimal memory addressing mode</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>Future Changes</strong>
		<ul>
		  <li>bug with some registers being confused with immediate values..
		ie. cmp al,dh (cmp reg8,reg8)-&gt; cmp al, 0Dh (cmp reg8,i8)</li>
		  <li>bug after disassembling a file and closing the program, raises InvalidPointer or EAccessViolation</li>
		  <li>"sub di, 2" doesn't seem to do anything. This problem will be
		checked out.</li>
		  <li>support for using " quote signs to define character strings
		instead of just '</li>
		  <li>support for <b>DUP</b> in data definitions that duplicates data</li>
		  <li>should show an error message when a label is used that isn't
		defined</li>
		  <li>support for memory references that don't use square brackets but
		instead just use the name of a label</li>
		  <li>support for putting the prefix and assembly statement on the same
		line</li>
		  <li>adding a way of defining the type of "opcode" in the instruction
		sets. This can be useful in defining prefixes differently than normal
		opcodes so they can be assembled properly. There may be types of
		opcodes like "jump", "call"... That can help with jump detection and
		make it so data sections can be jumped over in the disassembling
		process. This would prevent the need for the rest of the program to be
		put into a hex dump instead of being properly disassembled. Labels
		could be created and refered to instead of constant numbers.</li>
		  <li>support for the EQU and = directives used in most assemblers.
		Also, possibly #define as used in c/c++ and rc files</li>
		  <li>more instructions being added to the instruction set files</li>
		  <li>support for procedures</li>
		  <li>support for structures</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="contact">Contact Information</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>If you have a question or a problem with this assembler, any tools
			with it or source code, contact me by email. My email address is <a
			 href="mailto:greijos@hotmail.com">greijos@hotmail.com</a>.
			</li>
			<li>Also, if you have any source code of your own that you want
			included with the program, please send it to me. It would be nice to
			have some more fairly simple examples with thorough documentation.
